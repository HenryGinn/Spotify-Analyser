## Overview

This program will produce statistics and infographics about a user's Spotify listening behaviour

## Setup

The folder structure should look like this:

Parent Folder
    Spotify-Analyser
    Results (created automatically by the program)
    Spotify API Keys.txt

The contents of "Spotify API Keys.txt" should look like this:

SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=AppClientID
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=AppClientSecret

"SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID" and "SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET" are the key words that the spotipy authenticator uses. You find these inside the settings of an app you have created on the "Spotify for Developers" website.
